We sincerely apologise for this; we are now working on Course subjects, since different colleges have different open elective subjects, it makes difficult for us to upload content for final year students.
Apart from this, we offer work skills courses in the app that would be more beneficial for you, and you can also check out several courses, among them HTML&css master class, Robotics, and several more on the app etc

---------------

Sorry download option is not available due to copyright issues. 
However, based on the students need, our back-end specialised team will come up with the download within the app functionality.

--------------------

As per you concern I have approached by backend team and known that,

As of now, the content for 4th year has not been uploaded to the app; the reason for this is that different colleges have different elective subjects, making it difficult for us to upload the content.

However, we have already begun the process; don't worry, whenever the content is uploaded, you will be receiving a notification from us.
